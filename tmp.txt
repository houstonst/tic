Logic
    -iterate through the sets of win conditions
    -for each value in a given set, check it's symbol based on the gridList data
    -if all symbols of a given set are the same, that symbol won

    or

    -create set of 'x' positions
    -create set of 'o' positions
    -add to each set as moves are made
    -iterate through the win condition sets after each move
    -if a win condition set is a subset of the 'x' or 'o' set, that symbol is the winner
